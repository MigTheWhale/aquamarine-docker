# Aquamarine-docker

WIP. This is a Docker setup for self-hosting the Aquamarine Miiverse Clone/Revival in your own computer

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need a computer that you have full root access running some Linux distribution (Preferbly Ubuntu LTS or Debian. Windows and macOS support is possible yet might require some extra work) connected to the public internet(meaning it's assigned to at least either one IPv4 or an IPv6 accessed from anywhere. HTTP tunneling might be possible to some extent but it needs to support TLS 1.0 for 3DS support) and a domain (FQDN) poiting to that IP. If you meet all of those requirements, open a shell windows and execute the following command and follow the setup wizard. 

 ``` curl -sSL https://github.com/MigTheWhale/setup.sh | sudo bash ```
